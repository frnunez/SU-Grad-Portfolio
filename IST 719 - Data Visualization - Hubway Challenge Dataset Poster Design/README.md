# IST 719 - Data Visualization - Hubway Dataset Poster Design

This repository contains files from my final project for the class, a Visualization of data we obtained from the Hubway Challange, a contest using data from Bostons Hubway Bikeshare program

The following files are included:
 - FinalProject_NunezFondeur.pdf - The final project poster created by my group consisting of myself and Antonio Llorens
 - FinalProject_NunezFondeur.mp4 - In addition to creating the poster, each team was to create a recording and present their poster. This mp4 file is a desktop recording narrated by myself. This file has to be downloaded.
 - FinalProject_NunezFondeur.R - The code we used to create our analysis, written in R
 - IST 719 - Data Visualization.ipynb - In order to make it easier to read the code, I created a jupyter notebook using R code to allow the entire code and visualizations to appear. NOTE the map visualization created using the leaflet package does NOT appear here. In order to view the map you will have to run the R code in R studio.
