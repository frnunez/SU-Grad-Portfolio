# IST719 Information Visualization
## Hubway Bikeshare Visualization Project

**Visualization of Blue Bike Share**
This project was a collaborative effort by Antonio Llorens and Francisco Nunez-Fondeur. For this project we decided to visualize the data from the bike sharing platform to get a better understanding about who uses the bikes and for what purpose, as well as how people get around Boston. The main goal is to answer:

1. Who is using Hubway?
2. Where is everyone going?

Our target audience is bike sharing customers, company stakeholders, city authorities, academics, data related profesionals.

**Background**
/n
Hubway is a bicycle sharing system in the Boston City area. Since its launch in 2001, Hubway has grown to more than 140 stations and more than 1300 bikes. In 2013, Hubway in parternship with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, released data from more than a half million trips that were taken on Hubway bikes between its launch on July 28, 2011 until the end of September 2012. In 2018, Hubway was rebranded as Blue Bikes.
