## ASD Screening Classification Project
**CLASSIFICATION OF AUTISTIC SPECTRUM DISORDER SCREENING DATA**

**Background**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and non-verbal communication According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 59 children in the United States. In 2013 the American Psychiatric Association merged four distinct diagnoses into one under the name of Autism Spectrum Disorder, there were previously referred to as Autistic Disorder, Childhood Disintegrate Disorder, Pervasive Development Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger Syndrome. For a long time, ASD was associated with a lengthy process to get properly diagnosed. With an increase in the number of ASD cases around the world, a faster screening tool was created called the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) consisting of 50 questions. A condensed version, the AQ-10, was created as a faster self-diagnosis tool to determine an individual’s position on the autism-normality spectrum. While the AQ-10 is NOT used for a definitive diagnosis, a score greater that 6/10 would be a flag that you should seek a professional diagnosis.

**Objective**

While the tool is a great first step, there aren’t many available datasets associated with clinical screenings and behavior. Per Fadi Fayez Thabtah, creator of the set, most available datasets on autism are genetic in nature. This set consists of the responses to behavior questions on the AQ-10 tool along with the results. In addition, 10 individual characteristics were made part of this set which have been used by the behavioral sciences experts for ASD detection. I intend to also use classification to determine the effectiveness of not just the AQ-10 tool but also the individual traits provided in diagnosing ASD by using classification and clustering algorithms. I will be using Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes, k-NN and Support Vector Machines.
